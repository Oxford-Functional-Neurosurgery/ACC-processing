## Introduction
This repository contains code for the analysis of data recorded from electrodes implanted in the anterior cingulate cortex of humans performing a cognitive task. Here, we analyse the network dynamics of the ACC to investigate the distribution of functions within this region which has been ascribed motor, cognitive and affective functions, and how these functional nodes interact.

This analysis has been formalised as a manuscript:

## Spatial and temporal distribution of information processing in the human dorsal anterior cingulate cortex

The contents of the repository provide an annotated walkthrough of the methods used for the preparation and analysis of the data recorded from the ACC for network analysis.

## Repository contents
The repository contains:

**ACC_dataprep.m** - a MATLAB script for extracting data epochs and formatting for analysis

**ACCanalysis.ipynb** - a Jupyter notebook providing a walkthrough of the data analysis process from data visualisation and preprocessing through initial analyses of conditions and analysis of network dynamics.
